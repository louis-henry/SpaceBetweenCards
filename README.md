A simple Java game developed during a group project assignment when studying at RMIT University between 2018 and 2021

# About
This was a university group project that was completed by several class members. It's a simple Java game that was done earlier
within the course and was one of the more foundational units as part of the bachelor degree. I have uploaded simply as a reference to
a Java project I have worked on in the past.
